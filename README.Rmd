The `weyl` package provides R-centric functionality for working with
Weyl algebras of arbitrary dimension.  A detailed vignette is provided
in the package.

# Installation

You can install the released version of the weyl package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("weyl")  # uncomment this to install the package
library("weyl")
set.seed(0)
```

The Weyl algebra is a noncommutative algebra which is used in quantum
mechanics and the theory of differential equations (Coutinho 1997).
The `weyl` package offers a consistent and documented suite of
R-centric software.  It is based on the `spray` package for sparse
arrays which confers computational efficiency.


# The `weyl` package in use

The basic creation function is `weyl()`, which takes a `spray` object
and returns a member of the Weyl algebra.

```{r makespray}
S <- spray(rbind(c(1,0,0,1,1,0),c(0,1,1,3,2,0)) ,1:2)
S
```

Above, object `S` is a standard `spray` object but to work with Weyl
algebra we need to coerce it to a `weyl` object with `weyl()`:

```{r makeweyl}
W <- weyl(S)
W
```

Above, object `W` is a member of the third Weyl algebra: that is, the
algebra generated by $\left\lbrace
x,y,z,\partial_x,\partial_y,\partial_z\right\rbrace$.  In this case
$W=x\partial_x\partial_y + 2yz\partial_x^3\partial_y^2$.  In other
words $Wf=x\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x\partial y} +
2yz\frac{\partial^5f}{\partial x^3\partial y^2}$.

We might ask what $WWf$ is, and this is easy in the package:

```{r calculatewsquared}
Wsquared <- W*W
Wsquared
```

This is a more complicated operator.  However, we might wish to
display it in symbolic form:

```{r winsymbolicform}
options(polyform=TRUE)
Wsquared
```
