A very nice youtube video by Borcherds
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVbfWunObYQ&ab_channel=RichardE.BORCHERDS)
discusses the fact that first-order differential operators do not
quite commute, but their commutator is itself first-order.
Symbolically, if

$$
D=\sum f_i\left(x_1,\dots,x_n\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\qquad
E=\sum g_i\left(x_1,\dots,x_n\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}
$$

where $f_i=f_i\left(x_1,\dots,x_n\right)$ and
$g_i=g_i\left(x_1,\dots,x_n\right)$ are functions,
then

$$
DE=\sum_{i,j}f_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\,g_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}
=\sum_{i,j}f_ig_j\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} +
f_i\frac{\partial g_j}{\partial x_i}\,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}
$$

$$
ED=\sum_{i,j}g_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\,f_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}
=\sum_{i,j}g_if_j\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} +
g_i\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}\,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}
$$

so $E$ and $E$ "nearly" commute, in the sense that $ED-DE$ is _first
order_:

$$DE-ED=
\sum_{i,j}f_i\frac{\partial g_j}{\partial x_i}\,\frac{\partial}{\partial
x_j}-g_i\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}\,\frac{\partial}{\partial
x_j}
$$

Above we have used the fact that partial derivatives commute, whence
the cancellation of the second-order terms.

We can verify this using the `weyl` package:

```{r}
D <- weyl(spray(cbind(matrix(sample(8),4,2),kronecker(diag(2),c(1,1))),1:4))
E <- weyl(spray(cbind(matrix(sample(8),4,2),kronecker(diag(2),c(1,1))),1:4))
F <- weyl(spray(cbind(matrix(sample(8),4,2),kronecker(diag(2),c(1,1))),1:4))
D
```

($E$ and $F$ are similar).  Symbolically we would have

$$D=
\left( x^6y^2 + 2xy^5\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+
\left(4x^7y^8 + 3x^4y^3\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}
$$

The package allows us to compose $E$ and $D$, although the composition is quite complicated:


```{r}
summary(E*D)
```

However, the Lie bracket, $ED-DE$, [or `.[E,D]` in package idiom) is
indeed first order:

```{r}
.[E,D]
```

Above we see that each row is either `1 0` or `0 1`, corresponding to
either $\partial/\partial x$ or $\partial/\partial y$ respectively.
We may verify Jacobi's identity:


```{r,verifyjacobi,cache=TRUE}
F <- as.weyl(spray(cbind(matrix(sample(1:9),3,3),matrix(c(0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1),3,3,byrow=T)),1:3))
.[D,.[E,F]] + .[F,.[D,E]] + .[E,.[F,D]]
```

Borcherds goes on to consider the special case where the $f_i$ and
$g_i$ are constant.  In this case the operators commute (by repeated
application of Schwarz's theorem) and so their Lie bracket is
identically zero.  We can create constant operators easily:

```{r,makeconstantops,cache=TRUE}
(D <- as.weyl(spray(cbind(matrix(0,3,3),matrix(c(0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1),3,3,byrow=T)),1:3)))
(E <- as.weyl(spray(cbind(matrix(0,3,3),matrix(c(0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1),3,3,byrow=T)),5:7)))
```

(above, see how the first three columns of the index matrix are zero,
corresponding to constant coefficients of the differential operator;
symbolically $D=2\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial}{\partial
y}+3\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ and $E=6\frac{\partial}{\partial
x}+5\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+7\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$.  And
indeed, their Lie bracket vanishes:


```{r label=abelianshow}
.[D,E]
```
