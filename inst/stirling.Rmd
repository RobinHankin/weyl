This short document shows how Stirling numbers appear when working
with the Weyl algebra.  Stirling numbers of the second kind, written
$S(n,k)$, count the number of equivalence relations on a set of $n$
elements having precisely $k$ equivalence classes.

Using Weyl algebra terminology, we consider powers of $x\partial$,
that is $(x\partial)^i$ for $i=1,2,\ldots$.  Taking $i=2$ as an
example, we have $(x\partial)^2=(x\partial)(x\partial)=x(\partial
x)\partial=x(x\partial+1)\partial=x^2\partial^2+x\partial$.  It can be
proved (but the margins are too small) that
$(x\partial)^n=\sum_{i=1}^nS(n,k)\partial^kx^k$.  Taking $n=7$ as an
example we have

```{r,label=xd7}
(xd7 <- (x*d)^7)
options(polyform = TRUE)
xd7
```

and it is possible to decompose this expression as follows:

```{r, label=decomposexd7}
f <- function(w){
   jj <- numeric(nterms(w)) 
   jj[index(w)] <- coeffs(w)
   jj
}
f(xd7)
```

We can compare this with results from the `multicool` package:

```{r, label=usemulticool}
 multicool::Stirling2(7,1:7)
```

giving identical results.
