# The first Weyl algebra

Consider the vector space ${\mathcal A}$ of linear operators on
univariate functions; ${\mathcal A}$ can be made into an algebra where
multiplication (denoted by juxtaposition) is defined as operator
composition:

\[({\mathcal O}_1{\mathcal O}_2)f={\mathcal O}_1({\mathcal O}_2f)\]

We consider the algebra generated by by $\partial\colon
f\longrightarrow f'$ [that is, $(\partial f)(x) = f'(x)$] and $x\colon
f\longrightarrow xf$ [that is, $(xf)(x) = xf(x)$].  This is known as
the (first) Weyl algebra.  We observe that the Weyl algebra is not
commutative: $\partial xf=(xf)'=f+xf'$ but $x\partial f=xf'$, so
$\partial x=x\partial+1$.  The algebra generated by $\left\lbrace
x,\partial\right\rbrace$ will include elements such as $7\partial +
4\partial x\partial^3 x$, which would map $f$ to $7f' +
4\left(x\left(xf\right)'''\right)'$.

It can be shown that any element of the Weyl algebra can be expressed
in the standard form

\[
\sum a_i \partial^{p_i}x^{q_i}\]

for real $a_i$ and nonnegative integers $p_i,q_i$.  Converting a
general word to standard form is not straightforward but we have

\[
\partial x^n = x^n\partial +  nx^{n-1}\]

and

\[
\partial^n x = x\partial^n +  n\partial^{n-1}.\]

We can apply these rules recursively to find standard form for
products $(\partial^i x^j)(\partial^l x^m)$.  Alternatively we may
follow Cock and use the fact that

\[
(\partial^i x^j)(\partial^lx^m)=
\sum_{r=0}^j{j\choose r}{l\choose r}\partial^{i+l-r}x^{j+m-r}\]

All this is done in the package.  Consider $d_1=\partial x +
2\partial^3$ and $d_2=3+7\partial -5x^2\partial^2$.  Observing
that $d_1$ is in standard form, package idiom would be:

```{r loadlib,echo=TRUE,print=FALSE,results="hide",message=FALSE}
library(weyl)
```		

```{r defineandprintd1d2}
d1 <- weyl(spray(rbind(c(1,1),c(0,3)),c(1,2)))
d2 <- weyl(spray(rbind(c(0,0),c(1,0),c(2,2)),c(3,7,-5)))
d1
d2
```

Observe that, like the `spray` package, the order of the matrix rows
is not defined.  We may apply the usual rules of arithmetic to these
objects:

```{r showmultiplication}
d1*d2
```

We may choose to display  results in symbolic form:

```{r showinpolyform}
options(polyform=TRUE)
(d1^2 + d2) * (d2 - 3*d1)
```

### Comparison with mathematica

Mathematica can deal with operators and we may compare the two
systems' results for $\partial^2x\partial x^2$:

`In[1] := D[D[x*D[x^2*f[x],x],x],x] // Expand`

`Out[1] := 4 f[x] + 14 x f'[x] + 8 x^2 f''[x] + x^3f'''[x]`

```{r}
x <- weyl(cbind(0,1))
D <- weyl(cbind(1,0))
x^2*D*x*D^2
```


# Further Weyl algebras

The package supports multivariate Weyl algebras.  Consider:


```{r showmultivariateweyl}
options(polyform=FALSE)  # revert to default print method
set.seed(0)
x <- rweyl()
x
```

Above, object `x` is a member of the operator algebra generated by
$\left\lbrace\partial_x,\partial_y,\partial_z,x,y,z\right\rbrace$.
We may verify associativity of multiplication:

```{r associativityisnontrivial,cache=TRUE}
x <- rweyl(n=1,d=2)
y <- rweyl(n=2,d=2)
z <- rweyl(n=3,d=2)
options(polyform=TRUE)
x*(y*z)
(x*y)*z
```

Comparing the two results above, we see that they apparently differ.
But the apparent difference is due to the fact that the terms appear
in a different order, a feature that is not algebraically meaningful.
We may verify that the expressions are indeed algebraically identical:

```{r verifyassociativity}
x*(y*z) - (x*y)*z
```

# Derivations

A _derivation_ $D$ of an algebra ${\mathcal A}$ is a linear operator
that satisfies $D(d_1d_2)=d_1D(d_2) + D(d_1)d_2$, for every
$d_1,d_2\in{\mathcal A}$.  If a derivation is of the form $D(d) =
[d,f] = df-fd$ for some fixed $f\in{\mathcal A}$, we say that $D$ is
an _inner_ derivation:

\[
D(d_1d_2) =
d_1d_2f-fd_1d_2 =
d_1d_2f-d_1fd_2 + d_1fd_2-fd_1d_2 = 
d_1(d_2f-fd_2) + (d_1f-fd_1)d_2 =
d_1D(d_2) + D(d_1)d_2
\]

Dirac showed that all derivations are inner derivations for some
$f\in{\mathcal A}$.  The package supports derivations:

```{r define_derivation_D}
f <- rweyl()
D <- as.der(f)  # D(x) = xf-fx
```

Then

```{r show_D_is_a_derivation,cache=TRUE}
d1 <- rweyl()
d2 <- rweyl()
D(d1*d2) == d1*D(d2) + D(d1)*d2
```

# Low-level considerations and generalizations

In the package, the product is customisable.  In general, product
`a*b` [where `a` and `b` are `weyl` objects] is dispatched to the
following sequence of functions:

* `weyl_prod_multivariate_nrow_allcolumns()`
* `weyl_prod_multivariate_onerow_allcolumns()`
* `weyl_prod_multivariate_onerow_singlecolumn()`
* `weyl_prod_univariate_onerow()`
* `weyl_prod_helper3()` [default]

In the above, "univariate" means "generated by $\left\lbrace
x,\partial_x\right\rbrace$" [so the corresponding `spray` object has
_two_ columns]; and "multivariate" means that the algebra is generated
by more than one variable, typically something like $\left\lbrace
x,y,z,\partial_x,\partial_y,\partial_z\right\rbrace$.

The penultimate function `weyl_prod_univariate_onerow()` is sensitive
to option `prodfunc` which specifies the recurrence relation used.
This defaults to `weyl_prod_helper3()`:

```{r}
weyl_prod_helper3
```

Function `weyl_prod_helper3()` follows Cock.  This gives the
univariate concatenation product $(\partial^a x^b)(\partial^c x^d)$ in
terms of standard generators:

\[
\partial^a x^b \partial^c x^d=\sum_{r=0}^b
r!{b\choose r}{c\choose r}
\partial^{a+c-r}x^{b+d-r}
\]

The package also includes lower-level function `weyl_prod_helper1()`
implementing $\partial^a x^b \partial^c
x^d=\partial^ax^{b-1}\partial^cx^{d+1} +
c\partial^ax^{b-1}\partial^{c-1}x^d$ (together with suitable
bottoming-out).  I expected function `weyl_prod_helper3()` to be much
faster than `weyl_prod_helper1()` but there doesn't seem to be much
difference between the two.

# Generalized commutator relations

We can exploit this package customisability by considering, instead of
$\left\lbrace x,\partial\right\rbrace$, the algebra generated by
$\left\lbrace e,\partial\right\rbrace$, where $e$ maps $f$ to $e^xf$:
if $f$ maps $x$ to $f(x)$, then $ef$ maps $x$ to $e^xf(x)$.  We see
that $\partial e-e\partial=e$.  With this, we can prove that
$\partial^ne=e(1+\partial)^n$ and $e^n\partial=e^n\partial+ne^n$ and,
thus

\[
(e^a\partial^b)(e^c\partial^d)
=e^{a+1}(1+\partial)^be^{c-1}\partial^d
=e^{a}\partial^{b-1}e^{c}\partial^{d+1}+ce^{a}\partial^{b-1}e^{c}\partial^d\]

We may implement this set in package idiom as follows:

```{r}
`weyl_e_prod` <- function(a,b,c,d){
    if(c==0){return(spray(cbind(a,b+d)))}
    if(b==0){return(spray(cbind(a+c,d)))}
    return(
    Recall(a,b-1,c,d+1) +
    c*Recall(a,b-1,c,d)  # cf: c*Recall(a,b-1,c-1,d)) for regular Weyl algebra
    )  
}
```

Then, for example, to calculate $\partial^2e=e(1+2\partial+\partial^2)$:

```{r}
options(prodfunc = weyl_e_prod) 
options(weylvars = "e")  # changes print method
d <- weyl(spray(cbind(0,1)))
e <- weyl(spray(cbind(1,0)))
d*d*e
d^2*e
```

By way of verification:

```{r}
d^5*e == e*(1+d)^5
```

which verifies that indeed $\partial^5e=e(1+\partial)^5$.  Another
verification would be to cross-check with Mathematica, here working with
$\partial e\partial^2e$:

`In[1] := D[Exp[x]*D[D[Exp[x]*f[x],x],x],x]`

`Out[1] := 2E^2x f[x] + 5E^2x f'[x] + 4E^2xf''[x] + E^2x f'''[x]`

```{r}
options(polyform = TRUE)
d*e*d^2*e
```

We can manipulate more complicated expressions too.  Suppose we want to
evaluate $(1+e^2\partial)(1-5e^3\partial^3)$:

```{r}
o1 <- weyl(spray(cbind(2,1)))
o2 <- weyl(spray(cbind(3,3)))
options(polyform = FALSE)
(1+o1)*(1-5*o2)
```

And of course we can display the result in symbolic form:

```{r}
options(polyform = TRUE)
(1+o1)*(1-5*o2)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
options(polyform = NULL) # restore default Weyl product
```
